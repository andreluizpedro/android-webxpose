The *WebXpose* is a tiny web server that lets you share files from your Android device using HTTP.


= Details =

It "listens" for connection requests on the port selected by you, so you should add ":port" in the URL used to access the content. For example: http://10.0.2.15:8080.

It also needs to open a port for administrative access. We suggest you always use the default values​​, which are 8080 and 8081.

As you start the server, an Android native service is created in a separate process, and keeps awaiting connections until you turn it off. You can disable the service running again WebXpose and clicking the "stop", or, open "Settings / Applications / Manage Services" and stop the service WebXpose.

You can only display files that are on your sdcard. You can leave the default "/sdcard" or you can create a subfolder within the sdcard with the files you want to share, which is safer.
